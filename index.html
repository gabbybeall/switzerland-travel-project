            <h3>Switzerland, playground of europe</h3>
            <p>
              Switzerland is a mountainous Central European country, home to
              numerous lakes, villages and the high peaks of the Alps. Its
              cities contain medieval quarters, with landmarks like capital
              Bern's Zytglogge clock tower and Lucerne's wooden chapel bridge.
              The country is also known for its ski resorts and hiking trails.
              Banking and finance are key industries, and Swiss watches and
              chocolate are world renowned.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Playground of Europe" is a nickname for Switzerland, due to its
              stunning Alpine scenery, diverse outdoor activities (skiing,
              hiking, paragliding), and high-quality tourism infrastructure, a
              term popularized by Leslie Stephen's 1907 book The Playground of
              Europe that described early mountaineering adventures in the Alps.

                  attractive. A wide range of activities and recreational
                  opportunities amidst unspoiled nature is waiting to be
                  discovered. Eiger village is the ideal starting point for the
                  best excursions to the Jungfrau region, such as Jungfraujoch -
                  Top of Europe, First, Kleine Scheidegg, Männlichen or
